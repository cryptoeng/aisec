Hey, I'm Benjamin, cryptography researcher at Fraunhofer AISEC in Berlin.

My research interests lie in the area of post-quantum cryptography. Currently I mainly work in the project "FLOQI" with focus on hybrid signatures and certificates. Before joining AISEC I was part of the Identity-Management group at Freie Universit√§t Berlin doing research on Physical Unclonable Functions and analysis of Boolean functions.
