Hi, I'm Franziskus, a security & cryptography engineer and researcher based in Berlin.

I'm heading the cryptography group at Fraunhofer AISEC. Before joining AISEC I was working on Mozilla's cryptography library NSS. I'm interested in everything around applied cryptography, in particular authentication and key exchange protocols, formally verifiable specifications and implementations of cryptographic primitives, and privacy preserving data collection and computation. I'm also the initiator and co-organiser of the Berlin Crypto Meetup.
