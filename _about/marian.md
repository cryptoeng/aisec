I'm Marian, cryptography researcher at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, but also part of the AISEC Crypto Engineering group.

I'm interested in Post Quantum Cryptography and its practical application. Before, I worked on the StudIES+ project. Earlier, I researched on hybrid classical/post-quantum key exchange as part of my master's thesis.
Starting fall of 2020, I also do teching in the post-quantum area.
