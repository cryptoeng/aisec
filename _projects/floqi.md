Global digital communication is secured by means of asymmetric cryptography to meet cryptographic security goals. The development of powerful quantum computers will in future threaten these security goals and the infrastructures behind them.
The goal of the project [Full-Lifecycle-Post-Quantum-PKI (FLOQI)](https://www.forschung-it-sicherheit-kommunikationssysteme.de/projekte/floqi) is to develop a public key infrastructure (PKI) that is resistant to attacks by quantum computers. These so-called post-quantum methods are to be implemented on a wide variety of platforms, including the automotive sector, Industry 4.0 and the finance sector. The parallel use of current and post-quantum methods will also be developed, implemented and tested. This will enable a step-by-step changeover that will prepare for a secure future in addition to the currently existing security.

The project is coordinated by operational services GmbH&Co.KG. Partners of the project are: Fraunhofer AISEC Berlin, Technical University Berlin, Robert Bosch GmbH, ESCRYPT GmbH, Diebold Nixdorf GmbH, BMW AG, D-Trust GmbH.
