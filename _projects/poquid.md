It is well known that once quantum computers of sufficient size have been developed, they can be used to attacked encryption algorithms which are securing the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. In the long term, these attacks also threaten the security of government-issued documents, such as passports and ID cards. To avert this threat ahead of time, PoQuID is researching the use of post-quantum cryptography in the context of sovereign documents.
The project is coordinated by Fraunhofer AISEC and conducted in conjunction with Infineon AG and Bundesdruckerei GmbH.
